I am a third year Ph.D. student at the [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://oden.utexas.edu/) at The University of Texas at Austin. I am currently also serving as the Vice President of the [UT Student Chapter of SIAM](https://siam.oden.utexas.edu/). I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, computational glaciology, and computational oceanography. I am currently working on two major projects with my advisor [Dr. Patrick Heimbach](https://heimbach.wordpress.com/) within the [CRIOS](https://crios-ut.github.io/) research group ‚Äê 

1. Paleochronometry as a control problem for recovering Holocene climate variations over the Greenland Ice Sheet 
2. Deep Learning Emulator for the dynamics of sea ice within the MITgcm model

Over the course of my work, I have collaborated with researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Hokkaido University, IIT Kanpur, and The French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA).

Previously, I completed B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering (with Honors) and Minor in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-Bombay), Mumbai, India in May 2019. I also received my Masters Degree in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics from UT Austin in May 2021. 

In my free time, I like hiking, playing chess, cricket, and reading (mostly history and fiction). All of these activities are a lot more fun when [Baloo](https://www.instagram.com/babybaloo.thelab/) is also involved.
