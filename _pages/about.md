I am a third year Ph.D. student at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin. I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, computational glaciology, and computational oceanography. I am currently working on two major projects ‚Äê 1. Paleochronometry as a control problem for recovering Holocene climate variations over the Greenland Ice Sheet, 2. Designing a Deep Learning Emulator for the dynamics of sea ice within the general ocean circulation model, MITgcm. Over the course of my work, I have collaborated with researchers from MIT, Argonne National Laboratory, UC San Diego, Hokkaido University, French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). I am currently also serving as the Vice President of the UT Chapter of SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics).

I completed B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering (with Honors) and Minor in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-Bombay), Mumbai, India.
