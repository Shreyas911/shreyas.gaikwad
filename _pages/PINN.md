Based on recent developments in Physics-Informed Machine Learing, we attempt to use a neural network for the following use cases:

- Emulate a highly non-linear, diffusive mountain glacier model
- Infer the coefficients of the mountain glacier model from artificially generated data

The code and the presentation can be found here[https://github.com/Shreyas911/PINN].
