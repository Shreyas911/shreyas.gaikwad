We tackled the following problems:

- Analysis of exponentially ill-posed heat equation (parabolic PDE) 
- Using *autograd* to minimize energy of a hanging chain subject to length constraints
- Image denoising while preserving sharp edges; formulated as infinite dimensionsal minimization problem
- Inverting advection-diffusion-reaction PDE for reaction coefficient
- An inverse problem for the Burger's equation
- Frequency domain inverse wave propagation for multiple sources and frequencies
