| Graphical visualization of a horizon clearly depicting geologic features such as incised valleys, channels, salt domes, and faults formed by the salt dome. Seismic data from the National Archive of Marine Seismic Surveys (NAMSS) |

Course advisor - Dr. Sergey Fomel, Dr. Zoltan Sylvester, Dr. Jacob Covault
Collaborator - Landon Lockhart

We explored the following Machine Learning applications in geophysics - 

- Regression to estimate sonic well log from gamma ray, resistivity, density, and neutron logs
- Classification model for predicting lithofacies from well-logs and geologic indicators
- Artificial Neural Network approach to pick a horizon automatically based on seismic data
- Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify Earthquakes from noise signals
- U-Net for image segmentation application in seismic fault detection
- Autoencoder for extracting useful patterns in order to pick horizons
- Correlating time series: Dynamic Time Warping and 3D optimization
