We explored the following Machine Learning applications in geophysics - 

- Regression to estimate sonic well log from gamma ray (GR), resistivity, density, and neutron logs
- CLassification model for predicting lithofacies from well-log measurements and geologic indicators
- Artificial Neural Network approach to pick a seafloor horizon automatically based on seismic data
- Convolutiona Neural Network in order to classify Earthquakes from noise signals
- U-Net for image segmentation application in seismic fault detection
- Autoencoder for extracting useful patterns in order to pick horizons
- Correlating time series: Dynamic Time Warping and 3D optimization
