| Posterior distributions for Stokes Model parameters generated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. (Figure 4 in UQ_Group4) |

Course advisor - Dr. Robert Moser

Collaborators - Shane McQuarrie, Caleb Phillips, Bassel Saleh

We tackled the following problems:

- Calibration of Stokes Drag with laboratory measurement data collected at UIUC
- Calibration of EBM model for climate change to surface temperature data
- Bayesian Model selection for opacity parameter of the EBM climate model
- Use of MCMC sampling to sample high dimensional posterior distributions

The reports can be found [here](https://github.com/Shreyas911/VUQ_course).
