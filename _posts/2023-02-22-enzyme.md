I will be attending the <a href="https://enzyme.mit.edu/conference">Enzyme Conference 2023</a> in Boulder, Colorado from February 22 to February 24. Enzyme performs automatic differentiation (AD) of statically analyzable LLVM. It is highly-efficient and its ability perform AD on optimized code allows Enzyme to meet or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art AD tools.
